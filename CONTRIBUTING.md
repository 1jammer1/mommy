# ðŸ¤  contribution guidelines
thank you for considering contributing to mommy!
below are some guidelines for contributions, but honestly, _any_ contribution is welcome, even if it's broken, because
surely we'll be able to figure something out together~

* add relevant documentation and tests~
* add relevant emojis in your commit messages~
* ensure that the tests pass (on your machine, at least)~
* describe your changes in `CHANGELOG.md`~
* your pull request should go into `dev`, not into `main`~
