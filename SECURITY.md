# 🛡️ security policy
even if this looks like a funny project, mommy takes security seriously.
mommy doesn't want any of her little children to get hurt!

if you discover or suspect a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue** because others could exploit
it before it's fixed.
instead, go to
[mommy's special "report a vulnerability" page on github](https://github.com/FWDekker/mommy/security/advisories/new) and
submit the issue there.
mommy's maids will respond to you as quickly as possible.
you will be thanked publicly for your report, unless you don't want that~
